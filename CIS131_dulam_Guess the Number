# CIS 131 Guess the Number 

#Write a script that plays “guess the number.” Choose the number to be guessed by selecting a random integer in the range 1 to 1000. Do not reveal this number to the user. Display the prompt "Guess my number between 1 and 1000 with the fewest guesses:". The player inputs a first guess. If the guess is incorrect, display "Too high. Try again." or "Too low. Try again." as appropriate to help the player “zero in” on the correct answer, then prompt the user for the next guess. Count the number of guesses the player makes. If the number is 10 or fewer, display "Either you know the secret or you got lucky!" If the player makes more than 10 guesses, display "You should be able to do better!" When the user enters the correct answer, display "Congratulations. You guessed the number!” and allow the user to choose whether to play again.
