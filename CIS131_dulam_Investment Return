#Lab: Investment Return
# 6/4/24

# Some investment advisors say that it’s reasonable to expect a 7% return over the long term in the stock market. If you begin with $1000 and leave your money invested, calculate, and display how much money you’ll have after 10, 20 and 30 years. Use the following formula for determining these amounts:

# a = p(1 + r)^n (^ means power of)
# where
# p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal of $1000),
# r is the annual rate of return (7%),
# n is the number of years (10, 20 or 30) and
# a is the amount on deposit at the end of the
# nth year.

#setting inital number of years in a list
numberYears = [10,20,30]

# setting constants for the rest of the code
p = 1000
r = 0.07

#setting a loop to run through the number of years avaliable for the investment return
print("With an intial investment of $"+ str(p),"and an interest rate of "+ str(format((r*100),'1.0f')) + "%, you will have made...")
for year in range(len(numberYears)):
    n = numberYears[year]
    a = p*((1+r)**n)
    year = year + 1
    
    # showing the user how much money total they would have after that many number of years 
    print("\n$" + format(a,'0.2f'),"after",n,"years.")
